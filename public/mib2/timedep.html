      <h1>Time-dependence of stochastic processes</h1>
      <h2>Free diffusion</h2>
      The Fokker-Planck equation describing the diffusion of a particle with a
      diffusion coefficient \( B(x) = 2D \), in an environment at temperature \(
      T \) and subject to a drift term \( A(x) = \frac{D}{k_BT}f(x) \), where \(
      f(x) \) is the applied force, is given by: $$ \frac{\partial p(x,t) }{
      \partial t } = -\frac{D}{k_BT}\frac{\partial }{ \partial x} (f(x)p(x,t)) +
      D \frac{\partial^2 }{ \partial x^2 } p(x,t)$$ Over time, diffusive motion
      makes the particle’s position increasingly difficult to predict given the
      knowledge of where it was initially. It is this increasing uncertainty
      that is described by the broadening of the distribution with time. This
      spreading out is actually a relaxation towards equilibrium; with no
      potential influencing the particle, it should be equally likely to be
      anywhere. Thus equilibrium predicts a flat distribution.
      <h2>The Langevin equation</h2>
      The idea of the Langevin equation is to take a complex stochastic process
      and split its updates into a potentially complex deterministic part, and a
      simple stochastic part. A single update for a trajectory \( x(t) \)
      sampled from \( X(t) \) is: $$ \Delta x = A(x)\Delta t + \sqrt{2D\Delta t}
      \Delta w$$ where \( \Delta w \) is a sample from \( \Delta W \), a
      Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 1. We can obtain sample
      trajectories from a continuous-time, continuous state process numerically
      by repeatedly applying the Langevin equation as an update rule. For a
      sufficiently small \( \Delta t \), the generated trajectories \( x(t) \)
      will approximate a representative sample of the true trajectories.
      <h2>Dynamics of population processes</h2>
      The simple representation of the Master equation for a population process
      as $$ \frac{dp_x(t)}{dt} = -(\lambda(x) + \mu(x))p_x(t) +
      \lambda(x-1)p_{x-1}(t) + \mu(x+1)p_{x+1}(t) $$ allows us to multiply both
      sides of the equation by \( x \), and sum over all values of \( x \), to
      derive the dynamics of \( \langle X \rangle \), the expected value of \( X
      \). Multiplying by x and summing over all possible values, we find that
      all of the sums on the right-hand side are expectations of quantities like
      \( x \) or \( x^2 \). This means \( \frac{d\langle X(t) \rangle}{dt} \)
      can be found using the ODE: $$ \frac{d\langle X(t) \rangle}{dt} =
      \lambda_0 - \mu_0\langle X(t) \rangle $$ We see that, even though
      individual trajectories of the immigration-death model can ary wildly, the
      average population obeys an extremely simple ODE, reaching a stable value
      at \( \langle X(t) \rangle = \lambda_0/\mu_0 \).
      <h2>Poisson point processes</h2>
      A Poisson point process is a population process that can only increase.
      <div id="vis1" class="vis"></div>
      In a general point process, the length of time between event \( n \) and
      event \( n+1 \) could depend in an arbitrarily complicated way on the
      history of the process. However, the simplest possible model is one in
      which the total number of events observed, \( N(t) \) is a
      continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process with a constant rate of
      transition \(\nu \) from \( N = n \) to \( N = n + 1 \). This type of
      model is known as a Poisson point process, and it is essentially an
      extremely simple population process in which the population can only
      increase by 1, and does so with a constant propensity.
      <br />
      <br />
      \( M \) is a random variable describing the number of events in a time
      window \( \Delta t \) of a Poisson point process. The distribution of \( M
      \) is a function of \(\nu \) and \( \Delta t \): \( p_m(\nu, \Delta t) \).
      This distribution is a Poisson distribution with mean \( \bar{m} =
      \nu\Delta t \): $$ p^{\text{po}}_m(\nu\Delta t) = \frac{ \exp(-\nu\Delta
      t)(\nu\Delta t)^m}{m!} $$
      <br />
      <br />
      The time gap between events in a Poisson process is an exponentially
      distributed continuous random variable (as in any continuous time Markov
      process). In an exponential distribution, the variance is equal to the
      mean squared. The number of events in a given time window follows a
      (discrete) Poisson distribution \( p^{\text{po}}_m(\nu\Delta t) \).
