        <h1>Population processes</h1>
        Population processes are the simplest processes with an infinite number of discrete states. Having an infinite
        number of states make it impossible to use the matrix based methods. However, typically the number of possible
        transitions from each state is very low. Normally, we assume that the population changes by only \( \pm 1 \)
        in a single event. Therefore there are only 2 possible transitions out of each each state (forward one or
        backwards one) and the process is fully described by population-dependent increase and decrease rates \(
        \lambda(x) \) and \( \mu(x) \).
        <div id="vis1" class="vis"></div>
        In the case of a 1 species population process with jumps of only \( \pm 1 \), it is possible to specify the
        Master equation is a single line:
        $$ \frac{dp_x(t)}{dt} = -(\lambda(x) + \mu(x))p_x(t) + \lambda(x-1)p_{x-1}(t) + \mu(x+1)p_{x+1}(t) $$
        In order for the equation to work for \( \frac{dp_0(t)}{dt} \) we define \( p_{-1} = 0 \).
        <br />
        <br />
        If only one specifes is considered, and only jumps of \( \pm 1 \) are allowed, then any stationary distribution
        must obey detailed balance. This is because transitions between \( X = 0 \) and \( X = 1 \) must balance in the
        stationary distribution (because otherwise we would have to compensate with flow to/from \( X = -1 \) while is
        impossible). This is turn means that transitions between \( X = 1 \) and \( X = 2 \) must obey detailed balance,
        as an imbalance cannot be compensated elsewhere. This argument applies inductively for all states.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to this property, we can easily calculate the ratio of probabilities in the stationary distribution...
        $$ \begin{matrix} \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_0} = \frac{\lambda(0)}{\mu(1)} \\ \frac{\pi_2}{\pi_1} =
        \frac{\lambda(1)}{\mu(2)} \\ \frac{\pi_2}{\pi_0} = \frac{\lambda(0)\lambda(1)}{\mu(1)\mu(2)} \end{matrix} $$
        However, for an infinite number of ever growing states, the system may never actually reach the stationary
        distribution.
