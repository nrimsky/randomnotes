        <h1>Continuous-state Markov processes</h1>
        Many systems have naturally continuous degrees of freedom, for example a diffusing particle. In this case, the
        probability of each state can no longer be represented by a finite-dimensional vector. Instead, we consider
        integrals of continuous function rather than sums of vector components. Thus the Master equation takes the form:
        $$ \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = \int_{A_X} dx'k(x|x')p(x',t) - k(x'|x)p(x,t) $$
        <ul>
            <li>\( k(x'|x) \) is the transition probability per unit time per unit \( x \)</li>
            <li>\( A_X \) is the domain of all possible values of \( X \)</li>
            <li>\( p(x,t) \) is a probability density, therefore \( \int_{A_X}p(x,t)dx = 1 \)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fokker-Planck equation</h2>
        When only short-range jumps in state are possible, as for a diffusing particle, it makes sense to Taylor expand
        \( k(x'|x) \), while allows use to rearrange the Master equation to the <i>Fokker-Planck equation:</i>
        $$ \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(A(x)p(x,t)) +
        \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(B(x)p(x,t)) $$
        where \( A(x) \) and \( B(x) \) are coefficients related to the details of \( k(x'|x) \).
        <ul>
            <li>\( A(x) \) is zero if transitions are intrinsically equally likely to be forwards or backwards ( \(
                k(x'|x) \) is symmetric about \( x \) ).</li>
            <li>When \( A(x) \neq 0 \) the system tends to move asymmetrically in one direction or the other. Therefore,
                the first term of the Fokker-Planck equation is known as the "drift term".</li>
            <li>If we let \( B(x) = 2D \) be a constant and \( A(x) = 0 \) then we see that:
                $$ \frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}p(x,t) $$
                This is known as the <i>Diffusion equation</i> and second term of the Fokker-Planck equation is known as
                the "diffusion term".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The stationary distribution for continuous-state, continuous-time processes</h2>
        We can find the stationary distribution of a continuous-state, continuous-time Markov process by solving the ODE
        $$ -\frac{d}{dx}(A(x)\pi(x)) + D\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(\pi(x)) = 0 $$
        This ODE can also be used to verify whether a candidate probability density \( \pi(x) \) is a stationary
        distribution, by checking whether 0 is obtained when it is substituted in. Normalisation and relevant boundary
        conditions must also be checked.
