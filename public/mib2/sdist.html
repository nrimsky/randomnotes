        <h1>Stationary distributions</h1>
        In many cases, the probability distribution of a stochastic system will tend towards a limiting result that is
        constant in time. A stationary distribution \( p_i(t) = \pi_i \) is a probability distribution that remains
        constant when the relevant time-evolution equation (transition matrix equation or Master equation) is applied to
        it. The fact the the probability distribution remains constant does not mean that transitions stop occurring.
        It simply means that probability flows into and out of each state balance each other and so the probability
        of being in a certain state is not changing. Not every stochastic process has a single, well defined stationary
        distribution.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a system does have a well-defined stationary distribution that is reached quickly, then a histogram of states
        visited by a sample trajectory will tend towards the stationary distribution as more and more states are visited
        (this property is known <i>ergodicity</i>).
        <h2>Mathematical condition satisfied by the stationary distribution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Discrete-state, discrete-time: $$ \pi(x) = \mathbf{T}\pi(x) $$</li>
            <li>Discrete-state, continuous-time: $$ \mathbf{K}\pi(x) = 0 $$</li>
        </ol>
        The condition in (1) means that \( \pi \) is an eigenvector of the matrix \( \mathbf{T} \) with an eigenvalue of
        1. Therefore, if we know that a single, well-defined stationary distribution exists, we can assume that one of
        the eigenvectors of \( \mathbf{T} \) has eigenvalue 1.
        <br />
        <br />
        The condition in (2) means that \( \pi \) is an eigenvector of the matrix \( \mathbf{K} \) with an eigenvalue of
        0. We can verify whether a candidate vector \( \pi(x) \) is a stationary distribution by checking whether it
        satisfies this condition. One must keep in mind the difference in the eigenvalue (0 vs 1) for stationary
        distributions in continuous-time and discrete-time settings.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is important to remember to normalise the stationary distribution (the vector elements sum to 1).
        <h2>Example problem: finding the stationary distribution for a discrete-time, discrete-state Markov process</h2>
        Given a transition matrix:
        $$ \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix}0.6&&0.4&&0\\0.3&&0.1&&0.2\\0.1&&0.5&&0.8\end{pmatrix} $$
        We can write down the equation that must be satisfied by the stationary distribution:
        $$ \begin{pmatrix}0.6&&0.4&&0\\0.3&&0.1&&0.2\\0.1&&0.5&&0.8\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\pi_1 \\ \pi_2 \\ \pi_3
        \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\pi_1 \\ \pi_2 \\ \pi_3 \end{pmatrix} $$
        We get the 3 equations:
        $$\begin{matrix}0.6\pi_1 + 0.4\pi_2 = \pi_1 \\ 0.3\pi_1 + 0.1\pi_2 + 0.2\pi_3 = \pi_2 \\ 0.1\pi_1 + 0.5\pi_2 +
        0.8\pi_3 = \pi_3 \end{matrix}$$
        These 3 equations are not linearly independent, which is always the case when finding eigenvectors. Therefore,
        we can ignore the 3rd equation. Instead as a third equation, we use the normalisation condition, which states
        that \(\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1 \). Using this information, we can solve to find that $$ \pi =
        \begin{pmatrix}0.2\\0.2\\0.6\end{pmatrix} $$
        <h2>Example problem: finding the stationary distribution for a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process
        </h2>
        Given a rate matrix:
        $$ \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix}-3&&0&&1\\3&&-2&&0\\0&&2&&-1\end{pmatrix} $$
        We can write down the equation that must be satisfied by the stationary distribution:
        $$ \begin{pmatrix}-3&&0&&1\\3&&-2&&0\\0&&2&&-1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\pi_1 \\ \pi_2 \\ \pi_3
        \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
        Using this and the fact that \(\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1 \), we get the simultaneous equations:
        $$\begin{matrix}-3\pi_1 + \pi_3 = 0 \\ 3\pi_1 - 2\pi_2 = 0 \\ \pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1 \end{matrix}$$
        This can be solved to find that $$ \pi = \begin{pmatrix}2/11\\3/11\\6/11\end{pmatrix} $$
        <h2>Flux</h2>
        The flux \( \phi_{ji} \) between states is the net probability that a system transitions from state \( i \) to
        state \( j \).
        <ul>
            <li>For a continuous-time process: $$ \phi_{ji} = K_{ji}p_i - K_{ij}p_j $$</li>
            <li>For a discrete-time Markov chain: $$ \phi_{ji} = T_{ji}p_i - T_{ij}p_j $$</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Detailed balance</h2>
        There are two fundamentally distinct types of stationary distribution, those that obey <i>detailed balance</i>
        and those that do not. For a stationary distribution that satisfies detailed balance, the flux \( \phi_{ji} = 0
        \) for every pair of states \( i,j \). In other words, a system is just as likely to go from \( j \) to \( i \)
        as it is from \( i \) to \( j \). These two transitions balance each other, and so does every other pair
        of states â€“ which is why it is known as detailed balance.
        <br />
        <br />
        As transitions between each pair of states balance each other in detailed balance, a system in detailed balance
        must be in the stationary distribution. However, one can have a stationary distribution which does not obey
        detailed balance. Below is an example of a system with a stationary distribution that does not obey detailed
        balance:
        <div id="vis1" class="sm-vis"></div>
        This is the stationary distribution of the system above:
        <div id="vis2" class="sm-vis"></div>
        The stationary distribution above does not obey detailed balance, which means there is a non-zero net flux. This
        reflects a tendency for the trajectories to move in a clockwise sense around the three state loop. This looping
        is characteristic behaviour for a system in the absence of detailed balance, however it is impossible when there
        is detailed balance.
        <div id="vis3" class="sm-vis"></div>
        The system above has a stationary distribution which does obey detailed balance where the net flux through each
        state is 0. The stationary distribution has the same probabilities of being in states A, B and C, namely 0.25,
        0.25 and 0.5.
        <h3>Detailed balance and relative probabilities</h3>
        The existance of detailed balance makes it easy to calculate the relative probabilities in the stationary
        distribution \( \pi_i / \pi_j \).
        $$ \frac{\pi_i}{\pi_j} = \frac{K_{ij}}{K_{ji}} \text{ or } \frac{T_{ij}}{T_{ji}} $$
        If it is impossible to directly transition from \( i \) to \( j \), we can still calculate \( \pi_i / \pi_j \)
        by finding an intermediate state \( k \) that allows a connection to be made:
        $$ \frac{\pi_i}{\pi_j} = \frac{K_{ik}K_{kj}}{K_{jk}K_{ki}} \text{ or } \frac{T_{ik}T_{kj}}{T_{jk}T_{ki}} $$
        <h3>Detailed balance in equilibrium thermodynamic systems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stochastic processes that are not driven by an input of fuel or energy at some level will eventually
                relax to an equilibrium stationary distribution. Conversely, continuous external driving can be used to
                keep a system out of equilibrium.</li>
            <li>Equilibrium distributions <i>necessarily obey detailed balance</i>, otherwise we could extract work from
                currents and violate the second law of thermodynamics.</li>
            <li>Stochastic processes that are not driven have transition matrices/rate matrices that are consistent with
                detailed balance, and hence detailed balance stationary distributions.</li>
        </ul>
        In biology, systems are often maintained at a constant temperature. The relative probability of states in governed by the Boltzmann distribution:
        $$ \pi_i  \propto \exp (-E_i / k_B T) $$
        Where \( E_i \) is the energy of state i, \( k_B \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is temperature is Kelvin.
        This means $$ \frac{\pi_i}{\pi_j} = \frac{K_{ij}}{K_{ji}} = \frac{K_{ik}K_{kj}}{K_{jk}K_{ki}} = \exp (-(E_i - E_j) / k_B T) $$
