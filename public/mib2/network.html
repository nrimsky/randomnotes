        <h1>Networks</h1>
        A graph is the mathematical description of a network. It consists of a series of nodes – these are the
        "entities" – and edges between those nodes that represent the links or connections. These edges can be directed
        (point from one node to another) or not, and sometimes they can have weights attached to them. Networks can show
        emergent behaviour that is fundamentally different from that of a single node.
        <h2>Basic properties of graphs</h2>
        <h3>Properties of nodes and small sets of nodes</h3>
        <ul class="spaced">
            <li><b>Degree:</b> The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to (adjacent to) a node. If the
                graph is directional, we can define an in-degree and an out-degree. Note that undirected self-edges
                contribute 2 to the degree (the edge connects twice).</li>
            <li><b>Adjacency:</b> Two nodes are adjacent if they are connected by an edge (this edge is also described
                as
                being adjacent to both nodes).</li>
            <li><b>Shortest path length:</b> the shortest path \( L_{ij} \) is the minimum path length from node \( i \)
                to \( j \). For an unweighted graph, this length is simply the number of edges that must be travelled.
                For a weighted graph, the distance is the sum over weights along the links. To find the shortest path
                between any two nodes, you can apply one of several well-known algorithms (eg. Dijkstra’s algorithm).
            </li>
            <li><b>Local clustering coefficient:</b> The local clustering coefficient of a node \( i \) is the
                proportion
                of the possible connections between the nodes adjacent to \( i \) that actually exist.
                $$ C_i = \frac{2n_i}{k_i(k_i - 1)} $$
                Here, \( k_i \) is the number of distinct nodes to which \( i \) is connected, and \( n_i \) is the
                number of edges within these \( k_i \) nodes (note that this quantity is ill-defined for nodes with
                1 or 0 neighbours; we shall simply set the local clustering coefficient to zero in such cases).
                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="flex-col mr">
                        <svg id="svg2" width="100" height="200"></svg>
                        <small>\( C = 1 \) for node A</small>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-col mr" style="max-width: 100px;">
                        <svg id="svg3" width="100" height="200"></svg>
                        <small>\( C = 1/3 \) for node A (there is only on connection between A's adjacent nodes)</small>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-col">
                        <svg id="svg4" width="100" height="200"></svg>
                        <small>\( C = 0 \) for node A</small>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br />
                <br />
                More than 0.5 is considered quite a high clustering coefficient.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topological properties of the graph as a whole</h3>
        <ul class="spaced">
            <li><b>Connectivity</b> In a connected graph, there is a path between every pair of vertices (the path can
                go through multiple intermediate nodes).</li>
            <li><b>Average degree:</b> The average degree \( \bar{k} \) is the degree \( k_i \) averaged over all the
                nodes in the network. We describe a network as sparse if the average degree is much smaller than the
                network size (most edges don’t exist).</li>
            <li><b>Adjacency matrix:</b> The adjacency matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) for a graph with \( N \) nodes is an \( N
                \times N \) matrix with \( A_{ij} = 1 \) if there is a connection from \( i \) to \( j \) in the graph,
                and zero otherwise. If the graph is directed, the adjacency matrix is generally not symmetric, however
                if it is undirected, then the adjacency matrix is directed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Network diameter:</b> The network diameter \( D \) is the maximum over all pairs \( i,j \) in the
                network of the shortest path length from \( i \) to \( j \), \( L_{ij} \) . It is therefore the shortest
                route between the most distant nodes.</li>
            <li><b>Global clustering coefficient:</b> The global clustering coefficient \( C \) is the local clustering
                coefficient averaged over all nodes in the graph</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Generic types of network</h2>
        <h3>Erdos-Renyi networks</h3>
        Erdos-Renyi networks are simple random networks that make a good starting point for comparisons to real-world
        data. To construct an Erdos-Renyi network with no self-edges, we specify a desired number of nodes \( N \) and a
        desired average degree \( \bar{k} \). We then consider each possible edge between nodes, and include each one
        independently with a probability \( q = \bar{k}/(N-1) \). The result will be a random graph with \( N \) nodes
        and approximately the desired average degree.
        <br />
        <br />
        Erdos-Renyi networks have a binomial degree distribution \( p(k) \). Here, the binomial "trial" is asking
        whether or not an edge exists, and a "success" is counted when the edge exists. In the limit of many nodes \( N
        \) and finite average degree \( k \) that significantly smaller than \( N \), the Binomial distribution can be
        approximated with a Poisson degree distribution with mean \( \lambda = \bar{k} \). Thus:
        $$ p(k) \approx \frac{\bar{k}^k \exp(-\bar{k})}{k!} $$
        The diameter of an Erdos-Renyi network grows much more slowly with its size (in terms of number of nodes) than a
        lattice network. It is thus much easier to reach distant points in the network in only a small number of jumps.
        <h3>Small-world networks</h3>
        A "small-world network" is a network with a diameter \( D \) that is surprisingly small for the network’s size
        \( N \) ( \( D \propto \log (N) \) ) given that it has a high global clustering coefficient \( C \) and sparse
        connections \( \bar{k} \ll N \).
        <ul>
            <li>The definition of a small world network has 3 conditions: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Small diameter \( D \propto \log(N) \)</li>
                    <li>Sparse connections \( \bar{k} \ll N \)</li>
                    <li>High clustering \( C > 0.5 \)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Sparse, highly-clustered networks with this small-world property seem to arise all the time in both
                biological (eg. molecular regulatory networks) and non-biological (eg. the internet) contexts.</li>
            <li>Most small world networks typically have degree distributions that differ markedly from Erdos-Renyi
                networks with the same average connectivity. \( p(k) \) for an Erdos-Renyi network is binomial /
                approximated with Poisson, giving a fairly sharply peaked distribution. However, many small-work
                networks have much broader distributions of \( p(k) \), with substanital probabilities of finding a node
                with degree much higher than average. These highly-connected nodes act as interconnecting hubs, allowing
                efficient hopping around the network and low diameter despite high clustering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scale-free networks</h3>
        Many natural networks – including most regulatory and metabolic networks, the internet and social networks,
        exhibit scale-free behaviour. Scale-free networks are characterised by a power-law distribution, for which (at
        least for large \( k \)):
        $$ p(k) \approx k^{\alpha} $$
        On a log-log plot, a power law is a straight line:
        $$ \ln p(k) = \alpha \ln k + \text{const} $$
        This is unlike a Poisson or binomial distribution. In particular, there is no natural peak at \( k \approx
        \bar{k} \), and no increasingly rapid drop-off beyond this point. There is thus no natural "scale" to these
        networks. The absence of an increasingly rapid drop-off in \( \ln p(k) \) at large \( \ln (k) \) for scale-free
        networks indicates an over-representation of highly-connected hubs when compared to Erdos-Renyi networks.
        <br />
        <br />
        The <i>Barabasi-Albert</i> algorithm, a form of "preferential attachment", generates scale-free networks. The
        basic idea is to have positive feedback, so that highly connected nodes gain even more edges.
