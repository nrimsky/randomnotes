        <h1>The Gillespie algorithm</h1>
        As an alternative to following the full probability distributrion, there is an elegant
        method for generating exact sample trajectories for continuous-time, discrete-state
        Markov processes, known as the <i>Gillespie algorithm</i>. The algorithm is event-based:
        the idea is to randomly generate the next event type and the next event time using
        the exact probability distributions specified by \(\mathbf{K}\).
        <ol>
            <li>
                First <a href="/ctmarkov.html#embedded">simulate the embedded discrete-time Markov chain</a>. This gives
                a sample of the sequence of states visited, however lacks information about the time taken for each
                transition.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, the simulation is augmented with samples of transition times.
                <br />
                \( \theta \), which represents the time taken to jump between states, is a random variable with
                probability distribution given by:
                $$ p(\theta) = k_{\text{tot}}e^{-k_{\text{tot}}\theta}$$
                where \( k_{\text{tot}} \) is the total transition rate out of that state.
                <br />
                We sample a time from this distribution for each jump.
            </li>
        </ol>
