        <h1>Discrete-state, continuous-time Markov processes</h1>
        <h2>Probability vector</h2>
        You can still represent the probability \( p(x, t) \) distribution as a vector, but it is defined as a
        continuous function of \( t \), not just at discrete values of an index \( n \).
        $$p(x,t)=\begin{pmatrix}p_1(t)\\p_2(t)\\...\\p_N(t)\end{pmatrix}$$
        Again, the sum of all the vector elements must equal 1.
        <h2>Rate matrix</h2>
        The key parameters that define the system's evolution are transition rates \( k_{ij} \) which are the
        probabilities per unit time that we observe a transition from \( j \) to \( i \).
        \( k_{ij} \) can be read as the rate of "i from j".
        $$k_{ij} = \frac{p(i,t+dt|j,t)}{dt}$$
        <div id="vis1" class="vis"></div>
        The continuous-time discrete-state Markov process represented graphically above can also be represented by the
        following rate matrix:
        $$ \begin{pmatrix} -1.7&&2&&0&&0\\0.2&&-2&&3&&0\\1.5&&0&&-3.1&&0\\0&&0&&0.1&&0 \end{pmatrix}$$
        As shown, in the rate matrix \( K_{ii} = -\sum_{j \neq i } K_{ji }\). In other words, the diagonal entries are
        negative the sum of the remaining entries in that column, making each column sum to 0.
        <br />
        <br />
        In diagrams representing continuous-time processes, absorbing states have no arrows coming out of them (there
        aren't any self-arrows). For example, state D in the example has no outgoing arrows.
        <h2>Master equation</h2>
        Since the system is continuous-time, instead of discrete difference equation, we have a set of coupled
        differential equations known as the <i>Master equation</i>.
        $$\frac{dp_{i}}{dt} = \sum_{j \neq i} (k_{ij}p_{j}(t) - k_{ji}p_{i}(t))$$
        The Master equation expresses how the probability of being in state \( i \) is increased by transitions into
        state \( i \) from other states and descreased by transitions out of state \( i \) into some other state \( j
        \). In matrix notation, the Master equation is:
        $$ \frac{dp(x,t)}{dt} = \mathbf{K} p(x,t) $$
        <h2 id="embedded">Finding the embedded discrete-time process hidden within a continuous time Markov process</h2>
        If you ignore the time taken between transitions, and just look at the sequence of states, the result is a
        discrete-time, discrete-state Markov process.
        Each jump of the continuous-time process defines a step of the discrete-time process. We say that this
        discrete-time process is "embedded" in the continuous time process.
        You can write down the transition matrix \( T \) for the discrete-time process directly from the rate matrix \(
        K \) for the continuous time process.
        $$ T_{li}^{\text{embedded}} = \frac{K_{li}}{\sum_{j \neq i }K_{ji}}$$
        for \( i \neq l \). \( T_{ii}^{\text{embedded}} = 0 \) by definition as the a step of the embedded process is
        defined as the point at which the state changes. The exception is if you have an absorbing state, in which case
        \( T_{ii}^{\text{embedded}} = 1 \) for completeness.
        <div id="vis2" class="vis"></div>
        For example, the transition matrix for the embedded discrete-time process in the continuous-time Markov process
        above is:
        $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0&&1&&0\\0.75&&0&&1\\0.25&&0&&0 \end{pmatrix}$$
        We can examine state 1, for example, and see that it transitions to state 3 at rate 1/s and to state 2 at rate
        3/s. This means that the probability of transitioning to 2 is 3/(3+1) or 3/4 and the probability of
        transitioning to 1 is 1/(3+1) or 1/4.
